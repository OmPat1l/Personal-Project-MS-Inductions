I have made this project for inductions of MindSpark 2022 as a web developer, which got selected :)
This is my first project using html css and a bit of JS,
there are many things i learnt while doing this project, tackling bugs, managing content, UI UX, 
and a ton of other things
 all this has further increased my interests in webdev
Few of the key features of this website include:-
1) Completely Responsive
2) Navigation toggle bar for mobiles and other small devices
3) Monotone and Minimilistic
4) Planned content to improve engagement(Visual heirarchy)
5) Backend integration with netlify, for form submissions
6) A score of 98 on #google lighthouse
7) Images gradients and a ton of #css styles.
